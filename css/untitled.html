            <strong>Stabilizing Evaluation</strong> (detox and medication modifications) Lindner Center of HOPE’s 10-day- plus residential programs help stabilize patients who are experiencing challenging mental health comorbidities including mood swings, thought disorders, emotional dysregulation and addictive disorders. In essence, we help patients slow down the fast moving train. Should a patient need a setting to manage higher risk issues, Lindner Center of HOPE also offers an acute inpatient program just steps away (for convenience and safety).

            <strong>Observation and Assessments</strong><br/>
            During their stay, patients are observed by their clinical team and other trained staff during daily groups and daily interactions.  Dedicated individual time with psychiatrist, therapist and other treatment professionals offers additional assessment and evaluation opportunities.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Ongoing Treatment Rounds-Onsite</strong>, full time MD’s, psychologists, neuro-psychologists and other highly trained Lindner staff meet frequently to share real time observations,
            assessments, evaluations and testing results. This timely  feedback is a game-changer.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Neuro Psych Testing</strong><br/>
            For many patients, an important part of the comprehensive
            evaluation programming includes neuropsychiatric testing to help confirm diagnosis and provide valuable insights.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Feedback Session</strong><br/>
            Toward the conclusion of the 10-day residential evaluation programs the patient, family and referrer meet with the treatment team to discuss findings and next step recommendations. Individuals often comment that this opportunity brings to light the much needed information that can indeed change the treatment trajectory.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Ongoing Communication</strong><br/>
            A Lindner Center clinical social worker is assigned to each patient who oversees important and timely communication with the family and referrer. Key to our formula is helping to connect our work with your expectations.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Individualized Treatment</strong><br/>
            Next-step recommendations may include additional treatment weeks at Lindner Center of HOPE in key evidence based treatment areas such as: Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy (RODBT), Cognitive Behavior Therapy, OCD/Anxiety treatment (such as Exposure and Response
            Prevention (ERP)), Binge Eating treatment and Addiction Recovery (including Internet Addictions). The clinical team also works with the referrer to collaborate on other treatment options and programs in the wider national/international network of providers.
